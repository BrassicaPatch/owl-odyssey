"A star fell from the sky"

-Many star fragments. Have to find them all and return them
to temple/sky god/ what not. (because its more of an object
and not a companion of any kind, people dont intuitively know
you have it, and so those hunting it dont know youre a target
right off the bat until the find out) 
	Some found these by accident as well, and others
	are hunting for them

	Something bad will happen if the shards arent returned
	or something

--> Inner spirt thing, good idea for having a kind of thing
to direct the player, and also antagonize a bit, but dont
like the current execution
	--Inner Spirit thing (gold orbs are the hearts you
	can get for greater health, but you can trade them
	to inner spirit for ???)?

-> Get rid of past trauma or whatever. Player is a traveller
that came across a star fragment??

Therefore, player knows people around the world that they might
be able to recognize or who will help them with thier
journey

-- Have a pet sidekick / whatever that you can find or get that
follows you and helps you in battles??


--Squirrel in Tux with Chipmonk minions
