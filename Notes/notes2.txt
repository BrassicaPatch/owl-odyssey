Diria


Friend at beginning is very good friend. Player starts
with knowledge that star fragments are a danger to the world
and could potentially lead to its destruction. Player-Character
has the good intention to collect as many of these fragments
as possible in order to save the world, giving them to their
friend, who claims, due to some religous background or otherwise,
that they can return them to the Gods via some temple. As the 
game progresses, and collection goes on, red flags start to show
and reveal themselves (cult getting more powerful, world getting
worse, whatever, etc), with notes also being pointed out by your
internal demon spirit thingy. As you come to discover and realize,
your friend is actually a member of the cult, and instead of 
returning the fragments, has been handing them over to the cult.
However, the way to return the fragments as described by your friend
is in fact true, and you set off to fight the cult, recover the
fragments, and return them to their proper origin.

==How does inner spirit play into rest of story / whatever?
	-Does it need to at all??

==Does player find new people to assist them after friend 
	betrayal, or do they continue on alone??

	-Maybe player tries to go it alone? It fails or goes
	badly, and then they discover a new group of goodies.

==As the game goes on, the wolrd slowly gets more dull and grey.
This is one indication that your efforts are not actually solving
anything. At one point, there is a total panic in a town. The moon
is bright and full in the sky, but all of the stars are gone...

Possible Intro Cutscene Exposition:

The world has long been divided...

between those that followed Oluna, the goddess of all that
is light...

and those that followed Eleyar, the god of all that is dark...

Dispite their opposing nature, they compliment each other
in a balance harmony...

However, there were still those, mortals, who had desire to see
one overtake the other...

For most of time, this was a simple impossibility for them
to accomplish...

until...
